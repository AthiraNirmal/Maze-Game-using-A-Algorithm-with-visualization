                                                    I. PROBLEM
To develop a game board which aims to find path from starting point to destination on a n*n box. There will be a user starting from first block who has to reach some designated block. On the way some in some cells there will be opponents who has some weights. Whenever user comes across one opponent, he will lose some points (representing low health points). If the point of user drops to zero, the game is over. The algorithm will find the path with maximum points. The algorithm used is A* algorithm along with the visualization.

                                                  II. A* ALGORITHM
A* is a very efficient algorithm and initially, the prime objective of the Algorithm was graph traversal problem to find the shortest path between two points. For the given problem statement, we implemented this approach to find the path which will have largest weights. A* actually extends the Dijkstra's algorithm along with some characteristics of breadth-first search (BFS). The main backbone of the algorithm is the heuristic function h, f and g. The heuristic function calculates the estimated total points from current node to end node, whereas the g function calculates the distance from start node to current node. The function f is the sum of both h and g. The next node to traverse is chosen according to the f value.
